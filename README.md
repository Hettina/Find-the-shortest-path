### My notes
* I've named the file named after Dijkstra, 
the person who created the shortest path algorithm.

* First we need to add the data. This would normally be in a database. 
I would think that the most suitable would be a graph database (e.g Neo4J).
In a real project this would be returned by an api call but to make thing simpler
I have just added it as a json file.

* I've used 'includes' which doesnt work on IE without babel or a polyfill.

* I would normally use sass but have used css due to time limitations.

* I would add validation on the inputs.

* I would add more unit tests to cover more complex scenarios.

* I've just used a clean simple UI - 
I would do a lot more with this given more time.
